### 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I'm currently a learner in the <strong>ALX Backend Software Engineering</strong> program, driven by a mission to use code to fight inequality in healthcare, education, and other socio-economic systems.  

I started my journey in software engineering because **I saw the power of technology in simplifying complex social problems—and I wanted to be part of building the tools that could make justice and wellness more accessible, especially for women and underrepresented communities.**

💡 I'm passionate about:
- Tackling inequality through tech
- Building APIs that support real-world functionality
- Creating digital platforms that amplify the voices of the marginalized
- Continuous learning and uplifting others in tech
